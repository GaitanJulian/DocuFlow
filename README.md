# DocuFlow

## Setup

1. Install Rust/Cargo so that `pydantic-core` can build its native dependencies. On Windows you can run the bundled `rustup-init.exe` (or grab the latest installer from https://rustup.rs/) and accept the defaults.
2. After Rust is available on your `%PATH%`, install Python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
